# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the "CutTheNoise" repository with the tagline "Keep the Signal, Cut the Noise". The repository is currently in its initial state with only documentation files and PDF backups present.

## Current Repository State

The repository contains:
- README.md with basic project information
- Several PDF files (financial documents and backups)
- No source code or configuration files yet

## Development Environment

This repository does not currently contain any programming language configuration files (no package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.), suggesting it's either:
1. A documentation-only repository
2. A repository that hasn't had its development environment set up yet

## Next Steps for Development

When code is added to this repository, typical development setup will likely include:
- Adding appropriate configuration files for the chosen technology stack
- Setting up build, test, and lint commands
- Establishing project structure and architecture

## Notes

- Repository is clean with no uncommitted changes
- Main branch is `main`
- No existing development tooling or CI/CD configuration present
